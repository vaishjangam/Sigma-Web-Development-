            <h3>Meet Merry</h3>
            <p>
                Merry is a charming and playful cat with a fluffy coat and bright, twinkling eyes full

                and pouncing with adorable energy. With her soft purrs and gentle nuzzles, Merry is always 
                ready to snuggle up and bring warmth to her favorite humans. Whether she's lazily basking in
                the sunlight or mischievously sneaking around, her cute antics make her impossible to resist! 🐱💕
